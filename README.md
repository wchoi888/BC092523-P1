# Crypocurrency Tracker

## Overview

The Cryptocurrency Tracker App is an intuitive web application designed to empower users with seamless real-time conversion of cryptocurrency values to five popular fiat currencies (US Dollar, British Pound, Japanese Yen, Indian Rupee, and Euro) along with market cap information. This client-side application is crafted using HTML, JavaScript, and styled with the Bulma framework, ensuring a modern and responsive design.

## Usage

To make the most of the Cryptocurrency Tracker App, you have two convenient options for accessing real-time conversion rates and additional information. You can utilize the user-friendly drop-down menu, allowing you to effortlessly select the cryptocurrency of your choice. Alternatively, you can opt for manual input by providing the name or symbol of the cryptocurrency you wish to convert. The app will then automatically retrieve real-time conversion rates for the selected cryptocurrency against USD, JPY, EUR, GBP, and INR. Additionally, the conversion result will display the cryptocurrency's current market cap size, offering users valuable insights into its overall market standing. Whether you prefer the simplicity of the drop-down menu or the flexibility of manual input, the app ensures a swift and informative conversion experience, catering to both novice and experienced users alike.
